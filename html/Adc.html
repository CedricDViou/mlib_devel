<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Summary"> Summary </span></h2>
<p>The ADC block converts analog inputs to digital outputs. Every clock cycle, the inputs are sampled and digitized to 8 bit binary point numbers in the range of [-1, 1) and are then output by the adc.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Usage"> Usage </span></h3>
<p>The ADC block can take 1 or 2 analog input streams. The first input should be connected to input i and the second to input q if it is being used. The inputs will then be digitized to <code>Fix_8_7</code> numbers between [-1, 1). For a single input, the <code>adc</code> samples its input 8 times per IBOB clock cycle and outputs the 8 samples in parallel with o0 being the first sample and o7 the last sample. For 2 inputs, the <code>adc</code> samples both inputs 4 times per IBOB clock cycle and then outputs them in parallel with i0-i3 corresponding to input i and q0-q3 corresponding to input q. In addition to having 2 possible inputs, each IBOB can interface with 2 <code>adc</code>s for a total of 4 inputs or 2 8-sample inputs per IBOB. 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Connecting_the_Hardware"> Connecting the Hardware </span></h3>
<p>To hook up the ADC board, attach the clock SMA cable to the clk_i port, the first input to the I+ port, and the second input to the Q+ port. Check the hardware on the ADC board near the input pins. There should be for 4 square chips in a straight line. If there are only 3, the second input, Q+, may not work. Note that if you chose <code>adc0_clk</code>, make sure to plug the ADC board in to the adc0 port. The same applies if you chose <code>adc1_clk</code> to plug the board into adc1 port. If you are using both ADCs, then you need to plug a clock into both clk_i inputs and you should probably run them off of the same signal generator. 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="ADC_Background_Information"> ADC Background Information </span></h3>
<p>The ADC board was designed to mate directly to an IBOB board through ZDOK connectors for high-speed serial data I/O. Analog data is digitized using an Atmel AT84AD001B dual 8-bit ADC chip which can digitize two streams at 1 Gsample/sec or a single stream at 2 Gsample/sec. This board may be driven with either single-ended or differential inputs.
