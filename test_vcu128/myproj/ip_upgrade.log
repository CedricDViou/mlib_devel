Upgrade Log for IP 'gig_ethernet_pcs_pma_sgmii_lvds'

1. Summary
----------

CAUTION (success, with warnings) in the upgrade of gig_ethernet_pcs_pma_sgmii_lvds from xilinx.com:ip:gig_ethernet_pcs_pma:16.0 (Rev. 1) to xilinx.com:ip:gig_ethernet_pcs_pma:16.1 (Rev. 4)

After upgrade, an IP may have parameter differences compared to the original customization. Please review the parameters within the IP customization GUI to ensure proper functionality.

2. Upgrade messages
-------------------

WARNING: upgrade cannot remove parameter Transceiver_type : there is no parameter called Transceiver_type in gig_ethernet_pcs_pma_v16_0
WARNING: upgrade cannot remove parameter C_PHYADDR : there is no parameter called C_PHYADDR in gig_ethernet_pcs_pma_v16_0

3. Customization warnings
-------------------------

The normal upgrade process failed due to validation failures in the given configuration. Attempting partial upgrade to set as many user parameters as possible. Please check the parameters whose values were not applied.

Unable to set the value 'LVDS' on parameter 'Physical Interface' due to the following failure - 
Value 'LVDS' is out of the range for parameter 'Physical Interface(Physical_Interface)' for IP 'gig_ethernet_pcs_pma_sgmii_lvds' . Valid values are - Transceiver
. Restoring to an old valid value of 'Transceiver'


4. Debug Commands
-----------------

  The following debug information can be passed to Vivado as Tcl commands,
in order to validate or debug the output of the upgrade flow.
  You may consult any warnings from within this upgrade, and alter or remove
the configuration parameter(s) which caused the warning; then execute the Tcl
commands, and use the IP Customization GUI to verify the IP configuration.
